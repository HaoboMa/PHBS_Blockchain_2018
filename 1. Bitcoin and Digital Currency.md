Abstract: As a kind of point-to-point electronic cash that can circulate freely, bitcoin provides distributed ledger, transaction as settlement, anonymous transaction and other functions that cannot be satisfied by legal tender at present. But at the same time, its price fluctuates violently, making it difficult to have the value scale and value storage function of currency. While stable coin has solved the problem of price volatility, it still retains many benefits of a cryptocurrency that promises to be the settlement currency of the virtual world.

 

## **1. Bitcoin and Digital Currency**

### **1.1 Digital Currency Sketch**

According to the definition, the basic functions of currency including the measure of value, means of circulation, means of storage and means of payment. Since 1844, the central Banks gradually monopolized the right of currency issuance and took monetary policy as one of the important means of macro-control.

In 2008, Bitcoin was first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System as a kind of point-to-point Electronic Cash that can freely circulate. As the price of bitcoin has climbed in recent years, cryptocurrencies have attracted more and more users to participate. According to the Coinbase, it now has more than 20 million users.

Central Banks has now recognized that the development of crypto-assets such as bitcoin, which provide distributed ledger, transaction as settlement, anonymous transactions and other features that are not currently available in fiat currencies, could threaten their status.

Digital currency refers to the currency in digital form, which is different from paper money, coins and other real currencies. Digital currencies represented by the central bank and cryptocurrencies represented by bitcoin belong to the category of digital currency. The difference is that central bank digital currency is issued by the central bank, while cryptocurrency, as a subset of virtual currency, is not issued by authoritative institutions such as the central bank. Cryptocurrencies are issued and operated on the basis of blockchain, using cryptography principles. But central Banks' digital currencies are not necessarily based on blockchain technology.

### **1.2 The advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin**

#### **1.2.1 The advantages for Bitcoin as currency**

##### **Lower the cost of issuance and transaction**

Due to the fact that Bitcoin deleted many middle parts in the transaction, the overall payment cost is reduced. At the same time, it saves the cost of money production and circulation.

##### **Increase the security**

As the decentralization design and the consensus mechanism, the information of account / ledger is hard to be attacked or modified by the hackers.

##### **Improve the efficiency**

The confirmation of the transaction and clearance are completed at the same time, and the introduction of the smart contract will continuously improve the efficiency.

##### **Anonymous trading**

Due to the anonymity of the crypto currency, this will attract those users with the need of anonymity.

 

#### **1.2.2 The disadvantage of the Bitcoin as currency**

##### **Price fluctuation**

The price of the crypto currency fluctuates severely which can be a lack of value storage. As the digital currency does not have the credit endorsement or the asset pledge, their price is only determined by the supply and demand. Since its issuance in 2009, the price is significantly fluctuating.

##### **The security problem**

Not the same as the security above, this part means when your account is attacked or error transfer, the transaction cannot be canceled.

##### **Illegal usage**

Due to its characteristic of anonymity, it can be used as the illegal way, such as the money laundering.

##### **Energy waste**

The mining mechanism and PoW system lead to the high cost of energy. The decentralization goal is achieved at the cost of efficiency.

##### **Transaction record transparency**

Although it has the anonymity character, the transaction can be seen for everyone.

##### **Determined total Bitcoin**

As there are only 210,000,000 Bitcoin in total, A deflationary currency can hardly meet the needs of economic development.

## **2. Stable Coin**

Due to the characters of the bitcoin, and solve the price fluctuation problem of the normal cryptocurrency, the stable coin was introduced to the market.

The stable coin can be classified as whether it have the backed asset or not:

Those with the backed asset can be furtherly separated as those backed by legal asset (such as the gold or legal tender) and those backed by the digital asset.

For those without the backed assets, to stabilize their price, one method is to control them by the algorithm another method is they are under the control of the central bank, i.e. the legal digital coin issued by the central bank.

The detailed classification of the stable coin is shown below:

At the end of 2018, the total market value of the major coin reaches 2.7 Billion USD, taking for 2% of the total market value of the crypto currency (According to CoinMarketCap). And due to the end of December 2018, USDT’s market value reaches USD 1.88 billion, taking up of more than 70% of the stable coin and ranks the 7th among all the crypto currencies. For its daily trading volume, it reaches USD 5.14 billion, taking up the 96% of the total stable currency and ranking the second among all crypto currencies, just behind the bitcoin.

### **2.1 Legal Asset Backed Sable Coin**

When the issuance institution issues the stable coin, they save the legal tender (mostly USD/EURO) or the gold as the mortgage, allowing the stable coin asset holders to redeem those assets at a certain designated ratio.

In the September of 2019, the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and Paxos Standard which are linked to the USD were approved by the New York Financial Service Department for their issuance. And their issuance will be under the regulation. At the same time, their fund account will be audited by the third-party auditor. The mechanism of the steps is shown below:

The major stable coins are listed below:

| **Coin Name**        | **Asset Backed** |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| USD Tether (USDT)    | USD              |
| True USD (TUSD)      | USD              |
| USD Coin (USDC)      | USD              |
| Gemini Dollar (GUSD) | USD              |
| Paxos Standard (PAX) | USD              |
| EURS                 | EURO             |
| DigixDAO (DGD)       | Gold             |
| HelloGold (HGT)      | Gold             |

### **2.2 Crypto-Collateralized Stable Coin**

The working system is similar to the Legal Asset Backed Coin. However, the major difference is that they use the digital assets as the mortgage. Due to the fact that the price of the digital asset is highly volatile, the asset mortgaged need to be actively adjusted. Compared to the legal tender, the crypto currency has the advantage of highly transparency. The major type of Digital Asset Backed Stable Coin are Dai, bitCNY, bitUSD.

### **2.3 Algorithm Controlled Stable Coin**

This kind of Stable Coin is based on the smart contract and the system will automatically increase or decrease the supply of the coin asset to adjust the supply and demand of the market. The steps below are the price-stable mechanism of the Algorithm Controlled Stable Coin.

## **3. The application of Stable Coin in the Cross-Border Trade**

### **3.1 Relative Stable Price**

As Chinese government has now had some restrictions and regulations on the foreign currencies, especially when there is a cash outflow of the foreign currency. This kinds of restrictions and regulations provide a great opportunity for the crypto currency as a mean of cross boarder money transfer.

But the price of the typical crypto currency like Bitcoin are greatly fluctuating, therefore both buyers and sellers suffer the risk of price fluctuation. Under this circumstance, the stable coin can easily solve this problem by introducing the price stable mechanism introduced above.

### **3.2 Traditional Cross Border Paying Steps**

For the major steps of the cross-border trade payment is shown below. This kind of process is introduced to solve the credit problem caused by the cross-border information asymmetry. The trade financing is as follows: Banks use short-term financing tools to finance the company based on their inventory, prepayments, and so on. Each transaction must have the support of the documents. The steps are complicated and the transaction fees are relatively high. The period of time for these steps are usually very long, which is about 1 months.

When introducing Blockchain into the cross-border payment, it usually solves the credit problem for the payers.

### **3.3 Blockchain’s Function in International Trade**

The smart contract technology of blockchain can realize the whole process control of trade links. By using smart contracts, all links of cross-border trade can be connected to the blockchain platform.

1) it can well solve the pre-loan investigation, in-loan review, and real-time monitoring of post-loan management, and ensure the mandatory and automatic execution of relevant processes after the trigger of preset conditions;

2) reduce manpower input and increase input-output ratio;

3) information centralization on the chain, to help Banks accurately verify and compare information, reduce the risk of fraud.

## **4. Challenges for the Stable Coin**

The stable coin, represented by USDT are operating well. The price of USDT, which has the highest market value, trading volume and the liquidity is basically 1 dollar. However, due to the supply and demand of the market, its price also fluctuated in an acceptable level. On October 2018, Bloomberg reported that the Noble Bank, the custody bank of the USDT is losing its client and was selling its asset. This report caused the squeeze crisis which caused the price of the USDT dropped for about 6% on October 18th, 2018.

The common challenges for all stable coins are privacy and the asset link.

Even though many people don't think they care about privacy, but businesses, governments, and financial institutions in stable bitcoin transactions certainly need privacy to protect their business interests, relationships, and so on. Completely transparent ledgers like bitcoin cannot be used for these purposes. Even if the bitcoin address is a pseudonym, the traceability also undermines fungibility, an essential feature of digital cash. 

Another challenge is that they are all designed to be tied to some underlying asset, usually the dollar. The problem is that people usually assume that they are the substitution of the dollar.

Because of the mechanism designed, the value of the stable coin usually converges around the dollar price. But as the floating price asset, when the stable coin you paid as the consideration is tightly anchoring to another asset, it means those asset being targeted can also play the role of paying, the stable coin is meaningless to some certain extent. Therefore, the pegged exchange rate is important, which allows the stable coin’s price not that unstable and at the same time fluctuate in an acceptable range.

 

## **5. Conclusion**

The lack of price stability prevents cryptocurrencies from replacing most forms of legal tenders, and stable coins can provide a solution. The unlink between new currency issuance mechanism and the government could lead to the end of some countries’ hyperinflationary policies, economic controls and other destructive policies.

In fact, some stable coin linked to the legal tender while other stable coin simulates the money issuing process of the central bank. Meanwhile, the issuance institutions are all the third-party institutions, which contributes to its credibility.

When the major problems raised above can be solved well, the stable coin will have a bright future.
